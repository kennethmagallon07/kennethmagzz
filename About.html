      Hi! I'm a passionate web design student with a deep interest in creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites. I'm currently studying the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while exploring modern tools like Figma and responsive design techniques. I believe in the power of good design to make a lasting impression and solve real-world problems...

      <p>
        My journey into web design started with a love for art and technology. I enjoy turning ideas into visual experiences and experimenting with layout, color, and interaction. Through hands-on projects and personal exploration, I've developed a growing portfolio that reflects my creativity, attention to detail, and commitment to learning.</p>
      
      <p>
        As I continue to build my skills, I'm eager to collaborate on meaningful projects, contribute to creative teams, and learn from experienced professionals. Whether itâ€™s designing a personal blog or a professional landing page, Iâ€™m excited to keep growing and shaping my future as a web designer.
